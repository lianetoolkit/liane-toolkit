## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.18.1)
- [Meteor](https://guide.meteor.com) (1.12.1)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (v4.0.0 or newer)

Install **Meteor** full-stack framework.

```shell
curl "https://install.meteor.com/?release=1.12.1" | sh
```

Clone this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lianetoolkit/liane-toolkit
```

### Configuration

Create a file at `.deploy/local/` and name it `settings.json`. You can find an example at `.deploy/settings.example.json`

#### Facebook configuration

Paste your client id and secret and on your Facebook App dashboard you must add the app domain and URL on the Dashboard settings and OAuth setup. Default is `http://localhost:3000`.

If you are using strict mode (recommended) on your Facebook OAuth configuration, make sure to use the following path: `http://localhost:3000/_oauth/facebook?close`

### Start the app

Make sure your **Redis** server is running and run your project.

```js
npm start
```

Once the app install all of its dependencies, it will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. The first user created is automatically set with the admin role.

## Routes Definition

This project uses **[FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router)** for routes definition. You can find and modify routes at `/imports/startup/client/routes.js`

## Application Structure

This projects follows Meteor guide recommendations for application struture.

    client/
      routes/                       # set up all routes in the app
      index.js                      # import client startup through a single index entry point
    server/
      fixtures.js                   # fill the DB with example data on startup
      index.js                      # import server startup through a single index entry point

## Cron jobs

This project uses **[Job Collection](https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-job-collection/)** as job manager. It allows to add schedule jobs for repeating tasks along the campaign.

## Internationalization

This project uses **[react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl)** for internationalization. You can find and edit translations at `/locales`.

Translation files are automatically generated through `npm run translations`. You can update the available strings by running this command and manually translating the desired lang file, located at `/locales/[lang].json`. _Do not manually insert new strings into the language files._
